The objective of this notebook is to present an extensive exploratory data analysis of crime in Chicago using the **Chicago Crime Dataset**.

In this notebook, I am going to explore more about crime in Chicago and try to answer a few questions:

* Has the frequency of crime in Chicago changed over the years?
* where does crime occur the most?
* Is there any relationship between the crime rate and the Arrest rate?
