The objective of this notebook is to present an extensive exploratory data analysis of crime in chicago using the **Chicago Crime Dataset**.

In this notebook, I am going to explore more about crime in Chicago and try to answer few questions:

* Has the frequency of crime in Chicago changed over years?
* where does crime occure the most?
* Is there any relationship between crime rate and Arrest rate?
