The objective of this notebook is to present an extensive exploratory data analysis of crime in chicago using the **Chicago Crime Dataset**.

In this notebook, I am going to explore more about crime in Chicago and try to answer few questions:

* How has crime in Chicago changed across years?
* Are some types of crimes more likely to happen in specific locations or specific time of the day or specific day of the week than other types of crimes?
